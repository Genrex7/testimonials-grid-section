							I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn

							student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
							program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
							were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
							The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
							learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
							have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an
							example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
							job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
							100% recommend! "
