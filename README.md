### What I learned

1.  **Responsive Grid Layouts with Tailwind CSS**:
    One of the key things I learned in this project was how to build responsive layouts using Tailwind CSSâ€™s grid system and breakpoints. This allowed the layout to adapt smoothly across different screen sizes.

    ```html
    <section
    	class="section-testimonials w-[19.5rem] text-[.8125rem] font-medium flex flex-col gap-10 md:w-[80%] md:grid md:grid-cols-2 md:grid-rows-4 desktop:grid desktop:grid-rows-2 desktop:grid-cols-4 desktop:gap-y-8"
    >
    	...
    </section>
    ```

    - I learned how to use responsive utility classes in Tailwind CSS to create flexible and adaptive layouts.

    - I used flex on smaller screens to stack testimonial cards vertically, and switched to grid on larger screens for better structure and spacing.

    - With `md:grid-cols-2 md:grid-rows-4`, I created a two-column layout on medium screens.

    - On desktop screens, I adapted the grid to `desktop:grid-cols-4 desktop:grid-rows-2`, organizing content into a wide four-column grid

2.  **Applying Background Images**:
    I learned how to apply background images effectively using Tailwind CSS. This involved setting the background image, size, and position to ensure it looked good across different devices.

    ```html
    <div
    	class="testimonial desktop:bg-[url(/src/images/bg-pattern-quotation.svg)] bg-no-repeat bg-[top_0rem_right_4.5rem] bg-size-[8rem]"
    ></div>
    ```

    - Used the `bg-[url('/path/to/image.svg')]` utility to set the image.
    - Combined it with bg-no-repeat and custom positioning like `bg-[top_1rem_right_2rem]` to control exactly where the SVG appears.
